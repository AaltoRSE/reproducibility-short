This episode presents a lot of different tools and opportunities for your research software project.
However, you will not always need all of them. As with so many things, it again depends on your project.

## Important for every project

* Clear file structure for your project
* At least consider reproducibility of your work

## Workflow tools will maybe make sense in the future

* In many cases, it is probably not needed
* You will want to consider workflow tools:
    * When processing many files with many steps
    * Steps or files may change
    * Your main script, connecting your steps gets very long
    * ... 

## When should I worry about dependencies?

* Your code depends on multiple other packages
* You want to avoid questions like: "What do I need to install to run your code"
* You want help yourself running your code 
    * after a few years 
    * on a different computer
    * ...

## Containers seem amazing, but do I have use for them?

* Maybe not yet, but knowing that you can ...
    * Run Linux tools on your Windows computer 
    * Run different versions of same software on your computer
    * Follow the "easy installation instructions" for an operating system that is not your own
    * Get a fully configured environment instead of only installing a tool
    * Share your setup and configurations with others
... can be very beneficial :)
